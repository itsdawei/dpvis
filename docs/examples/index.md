# Examples

These examples provide single Python files with fewer explanations than
tutorials.
To run each example, simply copy the code locally and execute the python file.
Make sure that you have [installed dpvis](../README.md#installation).
Here are the current examples:

- [Weighted Interval Scheduling](wis.ipynb)
- [Knapsack](knapsack.md)
- [Edit Distance](edit_distance.md)
- [Strange Printer](strange_printers.md)
